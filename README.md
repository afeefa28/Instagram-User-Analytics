Problem Statement for Instagram User Analytics - SQL Fundamentals Project:

Instagram, as a popular social media platform, relies on user engagement and activity metrics to guide its marketing strategies, product development, and investor relations. To effectively cater to the needs of both the business and its stakeholders, a detailed user analysis is essential. 
The objective of this project is to derive actionable insights from user data through SQL analysis, which will be utilized to improve marketing campaigns, enhance user engagement, and address investor concerns.

The analysis focuses on answering specific questions raised by Instagram’s management, categorized into two main areas: Marketing and Investor Metrics. Below are the specific problems to be addressed:

A) Marketing Insights
1. Rewarding Most Loyal Users:
    - Identify the top 5 oldest users who have been on the platform the longest. This will help in rewarding loyalty and fostering long-term engagement.

2. Remind Inactive Users to Start Posting:
    - Find users who have never posted a single photo. The marketing team plans to send promotional emails encouraging these users to make their first post.

3. Declaring Contest Winner:
    - Determine the user who received the most likes on a single photo. This insight will help in declaring the contest winner and promoting user participation in future contests.

4. Hashtag Research:
    - Identify the top 5 most commonly used hashtags on Instagram. This information will be valuable for partner brands to optimize their reach.

5. Launching Ad Campaign:
    - Find out the day of the week when most users register on Instagram. This will help the team decide the optimal day for launching ad campaigns to target new users effectively.
      
B) Investor Metrics

1. User Engagement:
    - Calculate the average number of posts per user and the ratio of total photos to total users. This will help assess whether users remain active or if engagement is dwindling.

2. Bots and Fake Accounts:
    - Identify users (potential bots) who have liked every single photo on the platform, which is an unlikely behavior for a normal user. This will help in identifying fake or spam accounts that could be 
      negatively impacting platform quality.
